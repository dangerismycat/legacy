#### What
InstaCutz is a platform to connect barbers with users for on-demand haircuts. Users can select from a variety of styles, or request a custom cut. A curated selection of barbers is available to fulfill any style. Payment is easy, using Stripe for credit card transactions.

#### Why
We pivoted from the previous app, Foodly, as the food delivery market is quite saturated. On-demand haircuts are useful for our busy lives, and thus far is an underserved market. We were able to adapt the structure of Foodly to fit our new needs and new product.
